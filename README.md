# gdx-bullet-gwt
Bullet extension for libgdx html5

First of all it would be nice if you help building ammo.js from source by adding missing implementation.  

This extension emulate java bullet extension to use ammo.js instead of c++ jni. If a error pops in its because the class/method is not yet implemented or ammo.js dont have the class/methods. Any optimization and adding missing implementation is welcome.
